*** Conditionals
| if   | 3 clauses: test statement, consequence, else      |
| cond | like a switch statement and can have many clauses |
| and  | returns NIL or the last non-NIL value             |
| or   | returns the first non-NIL value or NIL.           |

*** Creating local variables
| let  | create local variable(s) in a new lexical scope            |
| let* | like let, but required if variables have interdependencies |

*** Assignment
| setf | assign values to variables |

*** Keywords

Functions like member and remove that rely on equality use eql as the predicate by default.
An optional additional :test argument can be specified to change this:
e.g., (member '(5 diamonds) cards :test #'equal)

:test is also a keyword for the following functions: 
union, intersection, set-difference, assoc, rassoc, subst, and sublis.

Other useful keywords include the following:
| remove | :count <n>  | defines how many elements to remove      |
|        | :from-end t | remove starting from the end of the list |


*** Defining a function
